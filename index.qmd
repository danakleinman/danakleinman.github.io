# Welcome to my website!

Hi, I’m Dana Kleinman, a Master’s student in Biotechnology on the neuroscience track at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. I currently work as a laboratory intern and will begin my role as Scientist I at Amptiv Biosciences starting in December 2025. At Amptiv Bio, we focus on developing a novel class of post-synthetic chemical modifications that can be applied to any fully synthesized mRNA construct, regardless of sequence or size.

At Case Western Reserve University, I am the first student in the M.S. Biotechnology program. Through my coursework and research training, I have built a strong foundation in biotechnology, molecular biology, and current advances in the field—particularly those related to neuroscience and RNA therapeutics.

I completed my undergraduate education at Dickinson College (2020–2024), earning a B.S. in both Neuroscience and Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, and I graduated Magna Cum Laude. I was also a member of the Women’s Tennis Team, starting all three competitive years (my freshman season was canceled due to COVID-19) and serving as team captain during my junior and senior seasons. Throughout my time at Dickinson, I received multiple academic and athletic awards.

On this website, you will find my CV, a link to my LinkedIn profile, and my email if you would like to get in touch.
