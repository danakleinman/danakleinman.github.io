In my free time, I still play tennis for fun whenever I am able to! I also love to spend time with my family, my pets, and my friends. Being a Cleveland Native, one of my favorite things to do is go support Cleveland sports, specifically the Guardians games with my dad - we have had season tickets since I was 10!
